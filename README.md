### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sage, and I'm learning to code!
To be more specific, I'm learning how to code in JavaScript, Python, and HTML. I already have working knowledge of Python, and I'm proficient in C++.
Right now, I'm working on building a personal website! This way I can showcase my projects and learning journey in much more detail.
Hopefully I can make my mark here in a good way!
